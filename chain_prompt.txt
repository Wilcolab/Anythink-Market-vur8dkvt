Step 1: Write a JavaScript function named `toKebabCase` that takes a single string argument.

Step 2: Ensure the function converts the input string to kebab-case, replacing spaces and underscores with hyphens, and making all letters lowercase.

Step 3: Update the function so that it also handles camelCase and PascalCase inputs, inserting hyphens between words appropriately.
